# Google Code Jam 2021

## Qualification Round (27-28 March 2021)

### Post attempt reflection:

Questions were pretty interesting. Seems to be a sorting theme this year.

- **Q1 Reversort:** just implement the algorithm. I wasted time trying to think of a clever way to do it.
- **Q2 Moons and Umbrellas:** lots of cases, tedious. I wonder if there was a better way to do it.
- **Q3 Reversort Engineering:** this was fun and satisfying to complete.
- **Q4 Median Sort:** discovering the solution was tricky, but in the end it boiled down to bisection. But I don't think bisection is sufficient to pass the hidden test case since it requires too many queries. Curious to see what the optimal solution is.
- **Q5 Cheating Detection:** This one was tough, stats knowledge needed? Tried running simulations which led to interesting distributions. Luckily my heuristic method was able to pass test set 1. Does test set 2 require some statistical experiment analysis?

### Results:

Rank 3556. Failed Median Sort test set 3 and Cheating Detection test set 2.

## Round 1A (10 April 2021)

### Post attempt reflection

Difficult as per usual.

- **Q1 Append Sort:** Not too difficult but some edge cases not present in the sample data tripped me up.
- **Q2 Prime Time:** `O(2^n)` naive solution is easy and works for test set 1. No idea how to continue - need some clever way to work out how to divide into the two groups.
- **Q3 Hacked Exam:** didn't even know where to begin

### Results:

Rank 3600. Failed Prime Time test sets 2 and 3 and did not attempt Hacked Exam.
